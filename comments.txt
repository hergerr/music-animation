1] You implemented the application using (put a 'x' in the selected box, e.g. "[x] Vue"):
[x] Vue
[ ] JavaScript

2] You chose to implement the application using this technology rather than the other option because:
> Vue is VirtualDom based framework, thus the peformance is better.
> I estimated, that there could be lot of state management with bars - there was not.
> Dividing frontend code to components makes it simpler to keep in order and to understand for others.

3] How much time did you spend on this challenge?
> I spend ~5 hours on one sitting to make working version.
> I also took than some time (1-2 hours) for refactor, playing
> with settings and checking other possibilities to solve this problem.

4] What was the most time consuming part of this challenge?
> Understanding the necessary tools (audio processing, drawing and animating svg)
> reminding myself Vue (I used it last time 6 months ago)

5] Is the 'Start' button strictly needed? If so, why? If not, would you think it would be better to remove it?
> It is not needed. I think it would be better to remove it. Music could be for example started by pressing 'space'
> (of course information about it should be well visible).

6] Do you have any suggestions for improving the visual appeal or the user experience of this application?
> Make visualization full-screen with nice gradient as a background.
> Make custom player tool.
> Start on pressing 'space'.
> Include song name and author somewhere (maybe right-upper corner) instead of title 'Visualizer'.
> Find better font

7] (Only if you added more dependencies) For each added dependency, justify why you added it.

8] Do you have anything else to add to help us understand your approach?
